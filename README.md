# 🌐 HTML Learning Labs

This repository contains two introductory lab modules designed to help you learn and practice **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** — the foundation of all web development.

Each lab builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing new HTML concepts, from basic structure and formatting to forms, tables, and semantic HTML.

# Lab Module 3 — HTML5

## Overview

This lab introduces more advanced concepts in **HTML and HTML5**. You will learn about the difference between **block** and **inline** elements and how to use them to structure web content effectively.

We will also explore the `<div>` tag to organize and style web pages better. Additionally, you will learn about **HTML entities**, which allow you to include special characters in your web content. The lab will cover **HTML5 form elements** that provide enhanced functionality for web forms, including the use of the `<output>` element to display the results of calculations or actions directly on the page.

## 3.1 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have a basic understanding of how to:

1. Differentiate between block and inline elements.  
2. Use `<div>` for better web page organization.  
3. Apply HTML entities to display special characters.  
4. Implement various HTML5 form elements.  
5. Utilize the `<output>` element to display dynamic results.

## 3.7 Lab Exercise 3

A **web contact form** is an essential feature of modern websites, allowing users to submit inquiries, feedback, or requests easily. In this exercise, you will build a **simple contact form** using HTML that integrates an **inline calculator** to enhance user interactivity.

This exercise combines the key concepts from Lab 3, including:

- **Block and inline elements**  
- **`<div>`** for organizing content  
- **HTML entities**  
- **HTML5 form elements**
